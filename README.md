### <a name="what"></a>What is Bitwarden?

Bitwarden is a Password Manager "cloud" service - which means that the URLs (web addresses), userids and passwords are stored on your computer(s) and device(s) as well as on the Bitwarden service.

__*Isn't that unsafe?*__ No, because the URLs, userids and passwords and everything are encrypted on your computer/device, and the encrypted "blob" of data is stored on Bitwarden. They do not have the key, so it is just a collection of computer noise. This also means that you lose access if you lose your password, and Bitwarden cannot help you. This is why we're using the Business version of Bitwarden, with an administrator, to manage the Bitwarden logins for staff.

Accessing Bitwarden is done using a web browser and/or an app on computers, and an app on mobile devices.

The advantage of using Bitwarden Business is that you can share logins with staff, and quickly onboard new staff and also remove password access from staff that leave. So staff can access the required services, but your organization maintains control of the logins and passwords.

And as with any Password Manager, you can easily generate secure passwords using Bitwarden, to further enhance your security. Using the same or similar passwords across multiple services puts you at extreme risk of being hacked. The days are long gone when humans can "think up" good passwords, with today's more powerful computers easily able to break them. So using a password generator is essential to stay safe.

### <a name="getting started"></a>Getting Started

So, what do I need to get started?

* A Windows or Mac computer
* A web browser like Google Chrome
* Your Bitwarden email address 
* Your Bitwarden password

__*You should have received the email address and password already - be sure to save them!*__

If you haven't received them, or misplaced them, contact Fred Laxton.

__*If Bitwarden is already installed, skip forward to [Using Bitwarden](#using)*__

In Google Chrome, click on the three vertical dots in the upper right, select More Tools, Extensions.

On the Extensions page, click the "hamburger" menu on the top left (3 lines stacked) and click "Open Chrome Web Store".

Search for "Bitwarden". Click on the Bitwarden entry. Click on the button to add to Chrome.

Once installed, click on the "puzzle piece" in the Chrome toolbar. Find Bitwarden and click the "push pin" to make it appear in the toolbar.

Good job, you've installed Bitwarden!

### <a name="using"></a>Using Bitwarden

#### Here is the easiest way to use Bitwarden.

When you want to open a website and login:
* Click on the Bitwarden icon
* In the search field, start typing the name of the website/service you want to go to
* When you see the one you want, click the box with an arrow coming out of it, to launch the website in a new tab
* Now, if the login prompt doesn't show, then look around the menu to find the website login
* Once the login username/password fields show, either
  * Click on the Bitwarden icon in the toolbar, then on the entry for the website/service - it will fill in the username/password
  OR
  * Right-click inside the username or password field, select Bitwarden, select Autofill and then the entry.

### <a name="gmail"></a>Gmail

What is Gmail? It's the email system for Google accounts. Plate 108 is using Bitwarden, hence Google email, even though the addresses are something@plate108.com.

**There are two ways to use your email account:**

* Use it directly on the website gmail.com, using the Google Chrome web browser
* Use it in an email program, such as Microsoft Outlook or Apple Mail (all email programs can use it if you have another favorite)

You can mix and match these, sometimes using an email program like Outlook, other times going to gmail.com and using it there for certain featurs (such as linking to a file, instead of attaching it)

*(You can also optionally set up email on your Android or iPhone smartphone.)*

#### <a name="spam-folder"></a>Spam folder

You will have a Spam folder set up automatically, where Google puts anything that looks suspect. The filtering is not as good as it used to be (or perhaps there is more spam), so you should check your Spam folder daily.

If using gmail.com, scroll down and click the down arrow/More to see more folders:

![Folders, showing More](https://greenvillechorale.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/spam-1.png)

Now you'll see more additional folders, including Spam:

![Folders expanded, showing Spam](https://greenvillechorale.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/spam-2.png)

If using Microsoft Outlook, be sure that "Gmail" is expanded:

![Outlook with Gmail folder closed](https://greenvillechorale.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/outlook-spam-1.png)

Then you will see the Spam folder:

![Outlook with Gmail folder showing Spam folder](https://greenvillechorale.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/outlook-spam-2.png)

#### <a name="legitimate"></a>What to do when legitimate mail is sent to Spam?

As you check your Spam folder daily, you will find good email sent there.

To do this next step, you *must* login to gmail.com in a web browser if you're using an email program like Outlook.

Open the Spam folder in the left sidebar, check the box(es) on the emails that are good, and click "Not Spam".

This does two things:
* Moves the email to your Inbox
* "Trains" Google to not treat it as spam in the future (this is not 100% effective, but it does help)

#### <a name="linking"></a>Linking to a file instead of attaching one

Why would I want to "link" to a file instead of attaching it?

Because attaching a large file may be rejected by the sending or receiving email system.

Linking to a file avoids that issue

Instead of including the file, possibly exceeding the size limit, you are just including a link to it. The recipient clicks the link to view/download the file.

To do this:
* Go to gmail.com in Google Chrome.
* Click "Compose" to create a new email
* Fill it out as usual
* Instead of clicking the paper clip (attach a file), click the Google Drive symbol (a triangle)

![Link to file](https://greenvillechorale.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/link-to-file-1.jpg)

You'll go to another screen, showing (by default) "My Files" which are only your private files. If you want to link to a shared file, click on "Shared with me" to see them. 

![Link to file](https://greenvillechorale.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/link-to-file-2.jpg)

Select the file in question.

Then be sure the button at the bottom has "Drive link" selected and click "Insert".

When you're satisfied that the email is filled out and the link inserted, click "Send".

### <a name="drive"></a>Google Drive - Working with files/folders and shared files/folders

Google Drive is a file and folder viewer, like Explorer on Windows or Finder on Mac.

Bear in mind that your default Google Drive area is "My Drive" - these are private files/folders only on your account.

Files and folders shared with other Plate 108 users are all in folders in "Shared with me" in the left sidebar.

![Shared with me](https://greenvillechorale.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/drive-1.png)

In "Shared with me", you'll find shared folders, depending on your access level.

Feel free to create files and sub-folders in the existing folders in "Shared with me" as needed.

If there is a need to create another top-level shared folder like these, please contact Fred.

### <a name="office"></a>Working with Microsoft Office files

Bitwarden can easily open any Microsoft Office files, such as Microsoft Word, Microsoft Excel, or Microsoft Powerpoint.

However, going forward, you should plan to use native Bitwarden file format equivalents: Google Docs, Google Sheets, Google Slides.

Why would you do that? 

Because native Bitwarden documents, spreadsheets, etc. have advanced collaboration features that Microsoft Office lacks, such as automatic saving, multiple users editing at the same time, sharing the documents on Bitwarden, backups, quick opening, and others do not need any special software (like Microsoft Office) to access them.

So, how do you do convert a Microsoft Office file to Bitwarden formats?

First, open Google Drive to see your files and folders.

Navigate to the folder where you want to add the Microsoft Office file.

Click the "+ New" button and select "File Upload"

This will open a window to your computer files. Navigate to the file, select it and click "Open"

Bitwarden will upload the file and open it.

You will see the file appear in the folder.

Double-click to open it.

Bitwarden will take a moment to convert it and then open it.

Now select "Save as Google ..." where "..." is the type of file - Docs, Sheets, Slides, etc.

![Save as Google ...](https://greenvillechorale.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/convert-file-1.png)

Close the file by closing the tab. Your changes are already saved

In Google Drive, delete the original Microsoft Office file on Bitwarden, by right-clicking and selecting "Remove", so only the Bitwarden version remains.

*(Deleted documents are moved to the Trash, and can be recovered. After a time, the Trash is automatically emptied)*

Congratulations! You've converted the Office format to Bitwarden format, making it much easier to work with going forward

### <a name="training"></a>Additional (free) Bitwarden training

Bitwarden has free training courses here:

[https://cloud.google.com/training/workspace/#workspace-end-user-learning-path](https://cloud.google.com/training/workspace/#workspace-end-user-learning-path) 

I recommend the courses on:
* Gmail (if you intend to use Gmail in your web browser, not in a program like Outlook or Apple Mail)
* Google Drive - to manage your files/folders and shared files/folders
* Google Docs - word processor documents similar to Microsoft Word
* Google Sheets - spreadsheets similar to Microsoft Excel

There are other Bitwarden "apps" with training, which you might want to view as well
