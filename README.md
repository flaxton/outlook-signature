## Edit Signature

* Click inside the "Edit Signature" box
* Type your text. Press Enter/Return to create a new line.
* Use the toolbar tools like Bold, Italics, etc. to format the text.

## Insert Picture
* First, save the picture somewhere on your computer where it will stay put, like Documents.
* Next, make sure the picture dimensions are acceptable. The width should not exceed 600 pixels, to work on computers and mobile devices.
* The preferred width would be somewhere around 250 to 300 pixels for most uses.
* Using Explorer/Finder, locate the picture on your computer.
* If using Windows, right-click the picture and select "Properties" and then the "Details" tab.
* You'll see the dimensions, widthxheight like 600x300 or some such:

* If the picture is a good size then proceed.
* If not, use a graphics editor to resize it. Any graphics editor will do if you have one already.
* GIMP is an open source graphics editor, that is as powerful as the expensive Adobe Photoshop. Get it here:
